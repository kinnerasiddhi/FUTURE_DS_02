Task 2 â€“ Facebook Ad Campaign Analysis (Future Interns Internship)

During my Data Science & Analytics Internship with Future Interns, I designed an interactive Power BI Dashboard to analyze Facebook Ad Campaign data. The focus was to evaluate ad performance, audience behavior, and ROI, enabling marketers to optimize ad spend and identify high-converting customer groups.

ðŸ”¹ Core Features

Marketing KPIs Dashboard: Tracked CTR, Conversion Rate, CPC, CPA, CPM, and ROI.

Audience Insights: Breakdown of impressions, clicks, and conversions by Age & Gender.

Campaign Performance: Identified top-performing ads and their ROI contribution.

Interest Category Analysis: Highlighted the 5 most effective customer interest groups.

Budget Utilization: Visualized ad spend efficiency and engagement outcomes.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Techniques

Power BI â†’ Dashboard creation & business intelligence reporting

Power Query â†’ Data preprocessing & transformation

DAX â†’ Custom measures for ROI, CPC, CTR, and CPA

Visualization Design â†’ Clean layouts with slicers for interactivity

ðŸ”¹ Project Impact
This dashboard helps marketing teams to:

Pinpoint ads with the best ROI and scale them.

Detect target demographics most likely to convert.

Reallocate budget toward high-impact ad sets.

Translate raw ad data into clear, decision-focused visuals.

ðŸ”¹ My Learnings
Through this task, I enhanced my ability to work with marketing datasets, build KPI-driven dashboards, and apply data analytics to real-world business problems, gaining practical exposure to digital marketing analytics.

âœ¨ Compared to Task 1, this version is worded more towards marketing + business decision-making, making it feel distinct yet aligned.
